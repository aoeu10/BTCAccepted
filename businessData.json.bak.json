We strive to make each batch within 1-2 days and ship no later than 2 business days after it’s made, to provide you the freshest low sugar jerky. Ground meat jerky is easier to chew than jerky made from strips of muscle meat, because it’s got a more tender texture. We also occasionally make ground bison, ground elk, and ground chicken jerky (limited to supply availability).",
