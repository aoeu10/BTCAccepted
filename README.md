### About Our Directory
BTCAccepted.org is a directory of bitcoin-accepting businesses that are either online only or do not have a physical location. OpenStreetMaps and inclusion on BTCMap.org require a physical address. It was created by Scott in early 2025 as a project to help promote bitcoin adoption in his local area. It has evolved into an open source community-driven global directory with a goal to catalog bitcoin-accepting businesses wordwide. Please see the Contact Us page for more information and to learn how you can help.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to promote the adoption of Bitcoin by making it easy for consumers to find businesses that accept Bitcoin payments. BTCAccepted believes in the power of a bitcoin circular economy and a return to the roots of interacting directly with local businesses without the need for intermediaries. We believe that Bitcoin represents a significant step forward in the evolution of money, offering benefits such as:

- Decentralization and resistance to censorship
- Lower transaction fees
-Final immediate settlement without risk of chargebacks
- Financial sovereignty and control over your own money
- Protection against inflation and currency debasement

### How It Works
Our directory is regularly updated with businesses that accept Bitcoin payments. Each listing includes important information such as:

- Business name and category
- Location information
- Contact details
- Bitcoin payment methods accepted (on-chain and/or Lightning Network)
- Verification date
- Business website and social media links

### Join the Community
We welcome contributions from the Bitcoin community. If you know of a business that accepts Bitcoin but isn't listed in our directory, please contact us to have it added. You can either fill out the form or join our community on Github.
