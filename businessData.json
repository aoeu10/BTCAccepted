We strive to make each batch within 1-2 days and ship no later than 2 business days after it’s made, to provide you the freshest low sugar jerky. Ground meat jerky is easier to chew than jerky made from strips of muscle meat, because it’s got a more tender texture.

The effort was quickly replicated to translate the Portuguese and Dutch versions of Saifedean Ammous' best-selling book.\n\nOur Growth:\nFive years later, the network has published over 80 books, but this is only the beginning. Konsensus Network is a privately owned company that operates as a hub between authors, license holders, translators, distribution, and production channels.\n\nOur Mission:\nThe original focus of the team has been to raise awareness about Bitcoin and making information accessible through books. As the process of normalization unfolds, the focus is shifting towards broader topics, such as economics and liberty.

This is a project for Bitcoiners, by Bitcoiners. We will never accept fiat currency or any other forms of crypto.\n\nIt is important to distinguish our project from platforms that enable bitcoin or “crypto” payment to a user, sell it, and pay the supplier in fiat. Although we do appreciate the importance of such platforms and projects as part of Bitcoin adoption, such projects are essentially fiat on and off-ramps and ultimately contribute very little to the circular Bitcoin economy.\n\nThe basic outline of our business is for hosts to upload their properties to our site and guests to book their accommodation through us. We will keep our guests’ funds safe until after their stay is completed and then pay the host.",

    "description": "Artisan pecan butter, date bars and chocolates. Made in the Southeast USA. #hodlbar #hodlbutter\n\n#### The Heart of Oshi\nOshi is my small-batch passion project - pecan butter, date bars, and chocolates - crafted right here in the Southeast USA. It began with curiosity and grew into something I love sharing. The pecans are local and top-notch, paired with certified organic, clean ingredients. No shortcuts - just honest flavor.\nIt starts with smooth, rich pecan butter. Then the dates with its rich texture and caramel flavor. The chocolates? Date bar filling in a chocolate shell bars, discs, or balls. Each batch is unique, sometimes a limited run, always made with care.\n\n **The Problem & Solution**\nPecan butter is like looking for a unicorn in stores, and what's there often hides sugars that dull its flavor. Most snacks and bars are loaded with grains, fillers, or artificial stuff, frustrating clean eaters. Grain-free folks struggle to find protein-rich snacks that taste amazing. Buying quality food means clunky payment systems too.\nOshi's got you covered. My Hodl Butter, crafted with local, organic Southeast USA pecans, boasts antioxidants - 400% more than almonds, 566% more than peanuts - low carbs (~4g per 2 tbsp), and heart-healthy fats (~12g monounsaturated). My Hodl Bars pair it with dates, packed with fiber (~2g per date) and potassium (~167mg), for a grain-free, protein-rich snack. The nutty, rich pecans and sweet, caramel-like dates create a flavor combo that's pure magic. Hodl Butter shines in recipes from smoothies to sauces, and you can buy it all with Bitcoin for a seamless, value-driven exchange.\n\n#### Why Bitcoin?\nWe accept Bitcoin because it's more than payment - it's a mindset. I love skipping the middleman, trading directly with you. It's perfect for small makers like me and folks like you who value the real stuff. It's a circular economy: I craft, you enjoy, we trade value - no gatekeepers.\nBitcoin means freedom to me - building outside old systems, connecting with kindred spirits. Paying with it? You're not just buying - you're betting on a future we shape together.",

In fact, I resumed painting after almost thirty years, out of love.\nIn April 2022, I decided to give my wife an oil portrait as a present and I thought, \" ...if this painting comes out well and gives me satisfaction, I will start drawing and painting again, otherwise I will give up and abandon the idea forever\".\nReturning to painting after so long was not easy.\nThe portrait came out discreetly, but the satisfaction of executing it was enormous.\nSo I started displaying my paintings, first on Twitter, then on Instagram, and finally made this website.\nMost of my paintings often depict places I have visited that particularly moved me, in a style inspired by impressionist masters, past and contemporary.\nThank you to everyone who has read this far and to those who will support my art.",
