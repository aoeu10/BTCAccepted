            <h2>About Our Directory</h2>
            <p>BTCAccepted.org is a directory of bitcoin-accepting businesses that are either online only or do not have a physical location. OpenStreetMaps and inclusion on <a href="https://btcmap.org" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">BTCMap.org</a> require a physical address. It was created by Scott in early 2025 as a project to help promote bitcoin adoption in his local area. It has evolved into an open source community-driven global directory with a goal to catalog bitcoin-accepting businesses wordwide. Please see the <a href="contact_us.html" class="me-3 text-decoration-none">Contact Us</a> page for more information and to learn how you can help.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to promote the adoption of Bitcoin by making it easy for consumers to find businesses that accept Bitcoin payments. BTCAccepted believes in the power of a bitcoin circular economy and a return to the roots of interacting directly with local businesses without the need for intermediaries. We believe that Bitcoin represents a significant step forward in the evolution of money, offering benefits such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decentralization and resistance to censorship</li>
                <li>Lower transaction fees</li>
                <li>Final immediate settlement without risk of chargebacks</li>
                <li>Financial sovereignty and control over your own money</li>
                <li>Protection against inflation and currency debasement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-4">How It Works</h3>
            <p>Our directory is regularly updated with businesses that accept Bitcoin payments. Each listing includes important information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Business name and category</li>
                <li>Location information</li>
                <li>Contact details</li>
                <li>Bitcoin payment methods accepted (on-chain and/or Lightning Network)</li>

                <li>Business website and social media links</li>

                <details class="mb-3">
                    <summary class="fw-bold">How to start accepting bitcoin on my site?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2">There are several ways to start accepting Bitcoin on your site. You can use payment processors like BTCPay Server, OpenNode, or Strike, which provide comprehensive payment solutions. Alternatively, if accepting payments in person, the quickest way, which can get you up and running in seconds, is to create a free account on <a href="https://www.coinos.io" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">Coinos.io</a>.  Physical stores might want to consider using a point-of-sale (POS) system that supports Bitcoin. Square will be allowing bitcoin payments soon. For help setting up your own POS, please see directions on this page.</p>

                    <summary class="fw-bold">Do I have to be bitcoin-only to be included?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2">No, you don't have to be bitcoin-only to be included in our directory. We welcome businesses that accept Bitcoin alongside traditional payment methods, as well as those who are transitioning to accepting Bitcoin. Whether you accept Bitcoin through various payment processors or support both on-chain and Lightning Network payments, we encourage your participation. Our goal is to promote Bitcoin adoption and the Bitcoin circular economy. However, no other cryptocurrencies will be featured in our directory. You may still be included if you accept other cryptocurrencies, but your site may be relagated below other bitcoin-only businesses. </p>

                <details class="mb-3">
                    <summary class="fw-bold">How can I promote bitcoin adoption with my customers?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2">There are several effective ways to promote Bitcoin adoption with your customers. Start by displaying Bitcoin payment logos and QR codes prominently in your store or on your website. Consider offering small discounts for Bitcoin payments to encourage its use. Items priced in bitcoin could be a lesser cost compared with other payment methods, such as credit cards. You could do this because the use of credit cards carries a higher processing fee. It's also important to educate your staff about Bitcoin so they can confidently answer customer questions. Share Bitcoin educational resources with interested customers and consider running Bitcoin-themed promotions or events. Social media can be a powerful tool to highlight your Bitcoin acceptance and engage with the broader Bitcoin community.</p>

                <details class="mb-3">
                    <summary class="fw-bold">What are the tax consequences of accepting bitcoin?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2">Tax implications for accepting Bitcoin vary by jurisdiction, but there are some general considerations to keep in mind. Bitcoin transactions are typically treated as barter transactions, and you may need to track the fair market value of Bitcoin at the time of transaction. It's important to keep detailed records of all Bitcoin transactions and be aware of potential capital gains implications if you hold Bitcoin. We strongly recommend consulting with a tax professional familiar with cryptocurrency to ensure compliance with local regulations. In general, when accepting bitcoin in a point-of-sale transaction, counting it as a cash transaction for tracking purposes is ideal. Please review this site in the future for additional information on how to keep track of your business's bitcoin transactions. Note: This is general information and not tax advice. Always consult with a tax professional for specific guidance.</p>
